# Gaia_Summerschool_2019

A lecture on GaiaDR2 selection function and selection biases in general with a few illustrative examples.
Another lecture on Bayesian distance inference with a focus on priors.
Including a hands-on jupyter notebook with exercises on distance estimation from parallaxes including [Bailer-Jones+2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156...58B) working example where we extract the prior from [GDR2mock](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130g4101R) and inferences of cluster distances.
These were given on 4th of June 2019 in l'Aquila [Gaia summerschool](https://www.cifs-isss.org/)
